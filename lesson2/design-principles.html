            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <img alt="Marine Traffic" src="./images/marine traffic.png">
            <h3>Marine Traffic</h3>
            <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-44.362/centery:-2.669/zoom:13">marinetraffic.com</a>
            <p>This is a both perfect and simple exemple of Visual Hierarchy. The porpose of this page is show a map with the marine world traffic. Almost 98% of the page is a map. There are other resources on the page as premium recurses options but it's
                the priority. The second most important element is the search that is on the good place. If the user needs an another resourcer there are buttons indicating the options.</p>

            <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
            <img alt="Sony Store" src="./images/PS STORE.png">
            <h3>PS STORE</h3>
            <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/latest">store.playstation.com</a>
            <p>You can see the logo on the front page in two different forms. There's a main logo center aligned and on other on right of the page name with a different desing. The logo on the up center is the Play Station's logo but the other is a little
                bit different because is the same but a the same time it's not. The same logo but inside a bag standsfor the Play Station Store(PS Store) logo. Both Play Station but with the two differents branches. This is a smart way to repeat a logo
                in a different service provide for the same branding.</p>

            <h3>IMDB</h3>
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">imdb.com</a>
            <p>IMDB contains a lot of content so Hick's Law it's being used not just on Menus but also be using on the main. On the top a slide show with hot content and other few yellow options that can include all the page can provides even having a lot
                of content avaiable and daily publishing.
